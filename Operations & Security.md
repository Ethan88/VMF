# Operations & Security

Approximately 20 percent of our assets are stored offline in cold wallets, disconnected from the internet. Another 30 percent are stored with our partner bank, Uphold, a $1B full reserve institution that holds fiat, precious metals, and cryptocurrency. And 20 percent are held in staking or voting wallets, which sit on cloud VPS servers protected by two-factor RSA authentication.

The remaining 30 percent of funds are in active use, under purview of trading advisor Cody Hoffman, and are split between six exchanges using our proprietary Flux Trade tool. On each exchange we maintain over 20 wallets. In the event an exchange is breached and a coin stolen (the Bitfinex or Gatecoin cases, for example) our exposure for a given hacking event would be a maximum of 0.25 percent of funds.
