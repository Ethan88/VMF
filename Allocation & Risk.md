# Allocation & Risk

While fungible and often limited in issuance, some so-called cryptocurrencies behave more like equities or commodities. All are volatile. The VMF model creates a variety of managed and unmanaged tiers, resulting in a more stable investment than ETFs or trusts that track one coin such as bitcoin or ether. 

Each layer of the fund has a different risk-reward profile. Each tier has a coin that represents it. Investors may allocate their money to whatever tiers or combination of tiers they like, but not all tiers have equal inventory available for sale. Holding the digital cash instrument L0 or Lx is equivalent to holding all the underlying coins in the same proportion as the overall issuance, because they are redeemable instruments (like gold-backed paper notes). 

But risk remains, so we allow VMF managers to tune their risk profile by choosing how many coins they issue at each tier, plus of course the ability to choose which underlying crypto-assets they hold and trade in each tier. 

**NOTE** The maximum size of a VMF is hard-coded at 250 wallet addresses, with a coin issuance size of **4,000 coins**. This limits the size of any VMF to 250 individuals, less any wallet addresses issued to another VMF. 

At i2, our coins are sold at **$25,000 USD** each, with no discounts or giveaways, but a given VMF may price their coins at any opening price they see fit.
