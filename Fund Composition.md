# Fund Composition

The purpose of the fund is to serve as a high-return safe haven. It is modeled on the IMFâ€™s [Special Drawing Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights) basket, but modified to suit a different purpose: stable appreciation. This fund architecture is codified entirely in open source software; we encourage its replication.
