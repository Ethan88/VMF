# Fund Composition

From an investor perspective, the purpose of a VMF fund is to serve as a high-return safe haven. VMF structure is loosely modeled on the IMFâ€™s [Special Drawing Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights) basket, but modified to suit a different purpose: stable appreciation, rather than just stability. This creates many of the benefits of the Petrodollar (debts shrink; savings grow) without the (quantitative) inflation and subsequent price inflation in the small business arena. This fund architecture is codified entirely in open source software; transparency in all ways is what makes this whole thing work, hence the blockchain (ie., immutability as a backstop for fund managers).

### Liquid Tier (L-tier) is fully redeemable for A-Tier or R-Tier coins; transferable.

    <td>A wallet address issued by another VMF so as to transact in (and hold) its L0 coin.</td>

###Important Legal & Logistical Notes
* VMFs may interact by trading their L0 instruments only
* In a privately-placed VMF, the Actively Managed Tier (A-Tier) is fully redeemable for USD after ~10 years
* Member-investors holding A- and R-tier coins may sell them to other member-investors, brokered by the fund managers
* In a "public" (crypto-crowdsale) VMF, fund managers may choose their own lockup period, after which A- and R-tier coins would presumably be made redeemable in one of the underlying crypto-assets (eg., ether or bitcoin).
